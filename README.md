That's a simple arduino code for my ROBT 206 Final Project.
EMG signal is entered as an analog signal, which is then uniformly written on servo motors after being re-mapped in range of 0-180 degrees.
Index finger is missing because it has been damaged/shorted and become unusable
Analog input's average per 50ms is given, as not to damage servo gears with constant changes per loop iteration
